# This input file tests Skywalker's Fortran 90 module with a user-defined
# configuration tailored to a given test program, which only pays attention
# to "user" variables. This variant uses an "enumeration" ensemble, in which
# the parameter values for each ensemble are all listed explicitly and walked
# in lockstep (in contrast to the "lattice" ensemble, in which all values form a
# high-dimensional lattice in parameter space).
