# ensemble.

type: enumeration

settings:
  param1: hello
  param2: 81
  param3: 3.14159265357

# All parameters must have a single value (which means they're the same in
# every run) or be sequences of the same size, which is the number of members
# in the ensemble (in this case, 11).
input:
  p1: 1
  p2: 2
  p3: 3
  tick:        [0, 10, 1] # linear spacing from 0 to 10 in steps of 1.
  log10(tock): [1, 11, 1] # logarithmic spacing from 10 to 1e11 in powers of 10
